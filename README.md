# CXL Experiments

## Current State

This repo does nothing useful yet, it is a WIP

## Usage

`./go.sh` will build the docker container, gem5, m5, disk, and run the experiments. You can see output in `m5out/board.pc.com_1.device`

you can also just do one task.

Examples:
- only run the experiments `./go.sh run`
- only build the disk `./go.sh build_disk`
